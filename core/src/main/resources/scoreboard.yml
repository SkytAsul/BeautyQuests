  # If enabled, scoreboard lines containing a {quest_xxx} placeholder
  # will be automatically refreshed whenever the quest tracker is updated
  refreshLines: true
  # If enabled, lines containing quest placeholders which relies on context
  # (such as {quest_time_left} in the expansion) that are not available for the
  # currently displayed quest will not be shown.

# Lines contained in the scoreboard
#  Available parameters are:
#  * value: the value of line, surrounded by quotes (')
#   -> special placeholders: {quest_name}, {quest_advancement}, {quest_description}
#  * refresh: time in seconds before the line is refreshed (useful with dynamic placeholders)
#   -> not needed for {quest_xxx} lines if the "refreshLines" setting is set to true
#  * length: max length of the line, if the number of characters exceed this limit the line will be split
